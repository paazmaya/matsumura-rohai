## Background for the project name

The name for this project is honouring one great [bushi, Matsumura
Sokon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsumura_S%C5%8Dkon), who lived
in Okinawa, Japan, and a [Karate Kata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_kata) named after him.

Matsumura Sokon lived around ~1800 and was one very important contributor
to the local martial art, which we today know as Karate and Ryukyu Kobujutsu.
The kata named after him is called _Matsumura Rohai_, also known
as _Koshiki Rohai_ or _Matsumura no Rohai_, depending on who is writing it.

[Read more about why these martial arts are important for me at `karatejukka.fi`.](https://karatejukka.fi)

## Getting started

The project provides a Node.js based server and a front-end for modifying translations.
The back-end makes requests to the Microsoft Translate API and caches the received translations
to a SQLite database.

## Installation

While in Windows, different versions of Visual Studio might be problematic, thus failing `iconv` installation.
With different options to `--msvs_version`, one might succeed. Such options are `auto`, `2010`, `2012` and so forth.

```sh
npm install --msvs_version=2012
```

Please note that the minimum supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is `14.15.0`, which is [the active Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

## Usage

```sh
export MS_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=****
export MS_TRANSLATE_API_SECRET=****
node index.js
```
